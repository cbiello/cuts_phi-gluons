I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Simon Badger whose insights and knowledges in the subject matter steered me through this project. I am extremely grateful for his patience and availability to answer all my doubts. Thanks for having introduced me to the world of on-shell amplitudes and unitarity methods.\\
I also had the pleasure of meeting and collaborating with members of the \textit{JetDynamics} group. In particular I want to thank Jakub Krys and Simone Zoia for their time.\\
Special thanks to Paolo Torrielli for his fundamental advice during my bachelor and master studies in Turin. I thank him for having shared his interest in phenomenology which helped me to find my way in theoretical physics.\\
%I am also truly grateful to my family and my friends for their help and support throughout my studies.
I am also truly grateful to my family for their support and care throughout my studies, in particular to my mum, my dad and my brother Luca.\\
A special mention goes to Roberta with whom I shared any moment of this journey. I want to thank her very much for the love, support and patience she has shown towards me.\\
I had the pleasure of studying with friends who have shared with me the passion for theoretical physics, in particular Andrea, Davide and Leonardo. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all my friends, especially Francesco, Giacomo, Giovanni, Matteo and Umberto.
